# Learning about Version Control

Author: Mantram Sharma

Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

I believe that version control is great for allowing one to track all of the changes in a file or an entire repository of files. I can easily look at the commit logs on GitHub and identify when certain edits where made. Additionally, version control allows for collaborators to also look through other's work efficiently and follow a well-flowing work structure. 
What I genuinely find a little difficult about version control is that even though there is a well-flowing process for using version control, there is a great hassle when encountering merge conflicts. I have had to personally encounter this in one of the collaborative labs for DSCI521, where two students worked on the same line and resolving it was confusing and difficult, especially since it was the first time.
